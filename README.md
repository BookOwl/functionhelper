# functionhelper
Functional programming helpers for Python.

## Installing
functionhelper only relies on the standard library, so the easiest way to add functionhelper to your program is to just copy the functionhelper.py file into a place that your script can find.

## Documentation
I have added several docstrings. To see the docs, run `python3 -m pydoc functionhelper`

## Testing
I am using py.test for testing. To run the tests, clone the repo to your computer, install py.test with `pip install pytest` and then run `py.test test.py`

## Contributing
If you have an idea, make an issue about it and I will decide if it should be added. Pull requests are welcome.
